# GmodServerLinker
This is a script that allows for a client to be sent to a different server when they make contact with the entity that the script creates. The model that the entity uses was made by Dlaor and fixed by Gmod4phun. 

If you want to change the placeholder IP that it curently links to go to the server 1 folder then go to the init.lua(server side) file and read the commented instructions there 

If you want to make another entity that links to another server just copy and paste the server 1 folder but just change the name of the ENT in the shared.lua folder and change 
change the ip link per the instructions in the init.lua (server side file)
